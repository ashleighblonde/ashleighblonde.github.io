Never did I supsect that I would ever join the world of coders.
I decided to learn coding because I was hired on at a tech company 
that parteners with Flatiron. I would see the developers working and wondering what the heck was on their screen.
Before coding, I dabbled in modeling for a little bit and have a background in hospitality/operations. 
I'm so excited to be here!
